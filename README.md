## Architecture

WatchBox follows a clean architecture pattern with MVVM:

```
Views (SwiftUI) → ViewModels → Services → Repositories → Data Sources (CoreData/Network)
```

### Key Components

- **Models** - Domain models and CoreData entities
- **Views** - SwiftUI views for UI
- **ViewModels** - Business logic and state management
- **Services** - Network, streaming, and discovery services
- **Repositories** - Data access layer
- **Utilities** - Helper functions and extensions

For detailed architecture information, see [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Technology Stack

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **CoreData** - Camera configuration persistence
- **Keychain Services** - Secure credential storage
- **Network Framework** - Camera discovery and port scanning
- **URLSession** - ONVIF HTTP requests
- **VLCKit** - RTSP streaming and video decoding
- **Swift Concurrency** - async/await for asynchronous operations

## Security

WatchBox takes security seriously:

- **Keychain Storage** - All camera passwords are stored in the iOS/macOS Keychain, not in CoreData
- **RTSP Authentication** - Supports both Basic and Digest authentication
- **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SSL/TLS** - HTTPS validation for ONVIF requests

## Supported Cameras

WatchBox supports any camera that provides an RTSP stream, including:

- ONVIF-compliant cameras (auto-discovery)
- Hikvision
- Dahua
- Axis
- Reolink
- Amcrest
- Foscam
- And many more...

### RTSP URL Formats

Common RTSP URL formats for popular brands:

**Hikvision:**
```
rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/Streaming/Channels/101
```

**Dahua:**
```
rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0
```

**Axis:**
```
rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/axis-media/media.amp
```

**Reolink:**
```
rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/h264Preview_01_main
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### Development Guidelines

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftLint for code formatting
- Write unit tests for new features
- Document public APIs

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Connecting

1. **Check RTSP URL** - Ensure the URL format is correct
2. **Verify Credentials** - Check username and password
3. **Test Network** - Ensure camera is reachable on the network
4. **Check Firewall** - Ensure port 554 (or custom port) is not blocked
5. **Try TCP** - Some cameras require RTSP over TCP instead of UDP

### Discovery Not Finding Cameras

1. **Same Subnet** - Ensure device is on the same network as cameras
2. **ONVIF Support** - Not all cameras support ONVIF discovery
3. **Firewall** - Check that multicast traffic is allowed
4. **Manual Entry** - You can always add cameras manually

### Performance Issues

1. **Reduce Stream Count** - Limit concurrent streams (max 16)
2. **Lower Resolution** - Use substream instead of mainstream
3. **Network Bandwidth** - Ensure sufficient bandwidth for all streams
4. **Hardware** - Older devices may struggle with many streams
